# Overview

The `KEDF_MGP` module implements the nonlocal Kinetic Energy Density Functional (KEDF) proposed by Mi, Genova, and Pavanello in "Nonlocal kinetic energy functionals by functional integration," J. Chem. Phys. 148, 184107 (2018).

This KEDF is designed to capture nonlocal effects in the kinetic energy of the electron gas. The core of the functional involves a convolution of a transformed density `rho^(5/6)` with a nonlocal kernel `keKernel(:,:,:,1)` in reciprocal space. A vacuum cutoff function can optionally be applied to the density before this transformation.

# Key Components

- **`MODULE KEDF_MGP`**: The main container for the MGP KEDF calculations.

- **`SUBROUTINE MGPPotentialPlus(rho, potential, calcEnergy, energy, vacCutoff)`**:
  - **Description:** This subroutine serves as a public interface or wrapper that directly calls `MGPPotPlus` to perform the actual calculation of the MGP kinetic energy potential and, optionally, the energy.
  - **Arguments:**
    - `rho :: REAL(KIND=DP), DIMENSION(:,:,:), INTENT(IN)`: Electron density in real space (spin-independent).
    - `potential :: REAL(KIND=DP), DIMENSION(:,:,:), INTENT(OUT)`: The calculated MGP contribution to the kinetic energy potential.
    - `calcEnergy :: LOGICAL, INTENT(IN)`: If `.TRUE.`, the MGP kinetic energy is calculated.
    - `energy :: REAL(KIND=DP), INTENT(OUT)`: The calculated MGP kinetic energy.
    - `vacCutoff :: LOGICAL, INTENT(IN)`: If `.TRUE.`, a vacuum cutoff function (`CutoffFunc`) is applied to `rho^(5/6)`.

- **`SUBROUTINE MGPPotPlus(rho, potential, calcEnergy, energy, vacCutoff)`**:
  - **Description:** This is the core routine that calculates the MGP kinetic potential and energy.
    The potential is calculated as:
    `V_MGP(r) = rho(r)^(-1/6) * FFT_backward[ FFT_forward[ rho_eff(r) ] * keKernel(G,:,:,1) ]`
    where `rho_eff(r) = rho(r)^(5/6)` if `vacCutoff` is `.FALSE.`, or `rho_eff(r) = CutoffFunc(rho(r)) * rho(r)^(5/6)` if `vacCutoff` is `.TRUE.`.
    The energy is then calculated as:
    `E_MGP = (3/5) * SUM[ rho(r) * V_MGP(r) * dV ]` (the sum is over real-space grid points).
  - **Arguments:** Same as `MGPPotentialPlus`.

# Important Variables/Constants

- **Input Arguments:**
    - `rho :: REAL(KIND=DP), DIMENSION(:,:,:), INTENT(IN)`: The real-space electron density.
    - `vacCutoff :: LOGICAL, INTENT(IN)`: A flag to determine if the vacuum cutoff function should be applied.
- **Output Arguments:**
    - `potential :: REAL(KIND=DP), DIMENSION(:,:,:), INTENT(OUT)`: The MGP kinetic potential.
    - `energy :: REAL(KIND=DP), INTENT(OUT)`: The MGP kinetic energy.
- **Accessed Module Variables:**
    - `keKernel :: REAL(KIND=DP), ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION(:,:,:,:)` (from `KEDF_WTkernel`, likely via `KEDF_WGC`): The nonlocal kinetic energy kernel in reciprocal space. The component `keKernel(:,:,:,1)` is specifically used by this MGP functional. The actual generation of this kernel is expected to be done by `KEDF_MGPkernel` or a similar module that `KEDF_WTkernel` might point to.
    - `CutoffFunc`: (A function imported from `KEDF_WGC`) A function that applies a cutoff to the density in vacuum regions, used if `vacCutoff` is true.

# Dependencies and Interactions

- **`Constants`**: For `DP` (double precision kind parameter).
- **`OutputFiles`**: For `outputUnit` (Fortran I/O unit for standard output), though not directly used in the provided subroutines.
- **`KEDF_WTkernel`**: For the `keKernel` array. This indicates that the MGP functional relies on a kernel that might be shared with or is structurally similar to the Wang-Teter KEDF kernel, or `KEDF_WTkernel` is a common module for storing various KEDF kernels. The population of this kernel for MGP is expected to be handled by `KEDF_MGPkernel`.
- **`KEDF_WGC`**: For the `CutoffFunc` function, suggesting use of a common vacuum correction utility.
- **`Fourier`**: (Implicit) The `FFT` interface is used for transforming quantities between real and reciprocal space within `MGPPotPlus`. This is a critical dependency for the convolution operation.

**Workflow:**
When `MGPPotentialPlus` (or `MGPPotPlus`) is called:
1. It checks if `keKernel` is allocated.
2. If `vacCutoff` is true, it applies `CutoffFunc` to `rho` before further processing.
3. It computes `rhofs = rho^(5/6)` (optionally multiplied by `cutf`).
4. It performs `FFT_forward[rhofs]`.
5. This is multiplied by `keKernel(:,:,:,1)` in G-space.
6. An `FFT_backward` transform is performed on the result.
7. This real-space result is multiplied by `rho^(-1/6)` to get the `potential`.
8. If `calcEnergy` is true, the energy is computed as `(3/5) * SUM(rho * potential)`.

The actual `keKernel(:,:,:,1)` specific to MGP must be prepared by a separate module (e.g., `KEDF_MGPkernel`) before this module's routines can be used effectively.
