# Overview

The `RhoOptLOG` module implements an electron density optimization strategy using a Truncated Newton method where the optimization variable is `chi = ln(rho)`. Using `chi` as the optimization variable inherently ensures that the electron density `rho = exp(chi)` remains positive throughout the optimization process.

The core of the method, `LogTruncatedNewton`, aims to solve the Newton equation `H_chi * p_chi = -g_chi`, where `g_chi` is the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to `chi`, and `H_chi` is the corresponding Hessian. The Hessian-vector product `H_chi * p_chi` is approximated using finite differences. The resulting linear system for the Newton step `p_chi` is solved iteratively using an inner Conjugate Gradient (CG) loop.

After obtaining a search direction in `chi` space, it's transformed into an effective direction for `rho`. A line search (`LogLineSearch`) is then performed to find an optimal step size. Electron number conservation is enforced during the update of `rho` using an iterative Lagrange multiplier approach within `ConstrainLog`. A preconditioner based on the von Weizsacker KEDF can optionally be applied within the inner CG solver.

# Key Components

- **`MODULE RhoOptLOG`**: The main container module.

- **`SUBROUTINE LogTruncatedNewton(rhoR, energy)`**:
  - **Description:** The primary driver for the `ln(rho)`-based Truncated Newton optimization.
    1.  Calculates initial `dE/dchi = (dE/drho)*rho` (where `dE/drho` is obtained from `CalculatePotentialPlus` after transforming `rho` to `phi=sqrt(rho)` for that call) and the constrained gradient `g_chi = dL/dchi`.
    2.  Enters the Newton optimization loop:
        a.  Calculates the norm of `g_chi` and checks for convergence (`tolPot`).
        b.  **Inner CG Loop (solving `H_chi * p_chi = -g_chi`):**
            i.  Initializes CG: `p_chi = PrecondForLog(g_chi)`, residual `res = -g_chi`.
            ii. Iteratively updates `p_chi` and `bestDir` (best Newton step approximation).
            iii. The Hessian-vector product `H_chi * p_chi_cg_step` is computed by finite differences:
                - `rho_trial = rhoR * exp(epsilon * p_chi_cg_step_transformed_to_rho_space)`
                - Calculate `(dL/dchi)_trial` at `rho_trial`.
                - `H_chi * p_chi_cg_step = ((dL/dchi)_trial - (dL/dchi)_current) / epsilon`.
            iv. CG continues until `resres / refresres < tolCG` or max inner iterations.
        c.  Performs a line search (`LogLineSearch`) along the found `bestDir` (transformed appropriately for `rho`) to find an optimal step `dt`.
        d.  Updates `rhoR_new = rhoR_old * exp(dt * bestDir_transformed)`.
        e.  Calls `ConstrainLog` to iteratively adjust `rhoR_new` with a factor `exp(-mu*rhoR_old)` to strictly conserve electron number.
        f.  Recalculates `dE/dchi` and `dL/dchi` with the new `rhoR`.
        g.  Reports step statistics.
  - **Arguments:**
    - `rhoR :: REAL(kind=DP), DIMENSION(:,:,:,:), INTENT(INOUT)`: Real-space electron density.
    - `energy(:) :: REAL(KIND=DP), INTENT(OUT)`: Final energy components.

- **`FUNCTION ConstrainLog(nRho, oRho, numE, dt) RESULT(mu)`** (Internal to `LogTruncatedNewton`):
  - **Description:** Finds a Lagrange multiplier `mu` such that `SUM(nRho * exp(-mu * oRho))` equals `numE` (target total electrons). `nRho` is the density after a trial step `rho_old * exp(dt * line_dir)`, and `oRho` is `rho_old`. This is an iterative Newton-Raphson like solver for `mu`.
  - **Arguments:** `nRho` (trial density before this constraint), `oRho` (density before line step), `numE` (target electron count), `dt` (step size taken).

- **`FUNCTION Propagate(dir, den) RESULT(propagated_dir)`** (Internal to `LogTruncatedNewton`):
  - **Description:** Transforms a search direction `dir` (nominally in `phi` or `rho` space) into an equivalent search direction in `chi = ln(rho)` space. Approximated as `propagated_dir = ln(1 + dir/den)`. Includes cutoffs for stability if `dir/den` is too negative.
  - **Arguments:** `dir` (search direction in rho/phi space), `den` (current density `rho`).

- **`SUBROUTINE LogLineSearch(rho, line, phi0, dphi0, step, newrho, newpot, energy, outcome, totalsteps, care)`** (Internal to `LogTruncatedNewton`):
  - **Description:** Performs a line search for an optimal step size `step` along the direction `line` (which is `rho * p_chi`, the search direction transformed from `chi` space to `rho` space). The trial density is `rho_trial = rho_old * exp(step * line)`. The objective function is `E(rho_trial)`, and its derivative with respect to `step` is `dE/dstep = SUM( (dL/dchi)_trial * line * rho_trial ) * dV`. It uses a bracketing and interpolation strategy (likely cubic or quadratic, involving `amin(1), amin(2), amin(3)`) to satisfy Wolfe-like conditions or find a local minimum.
  - **Arguments:** `rho` (current density), `line` (search direction), `phi0` (initial energy `E(rho)`), `dphi0` (initial `dE/dstep`), `step` (INOUT), `newrho` (OUT), `newpot` (OUT, `dL/dchi` at `newrho`), `energy` (OUT), `outcome` (OUT), `totalsteps` (OUT), `care` (IN, controls Wolfe condition strictness).

- **`FUNCTION PrecondForLog(rho, p, which) RESULT(preconditioned_p)`** (Internal to `LogTruncatedNewton`):
  - **Description:** Applies a preconditioner `M^-1` to the vector `p` (residual in `chi` space). If `which=1` and `mu_vW /= 0`, it uses a von Weizsacker-like preconditioner: `M^-1 * p = (4/mu_vW) * (1/sqrt(rho)) * FFT^-1[ FFT[p/sqrt(rho)] / G^2 ]`. Otherwise, it returns `p` (no preconditioning).
  - **Arguments:** `rho`, `p` (residual `dL/dchi`), `which` (preconditioner type).

The `LogTruncatedNewton` method is an advanced density optimizer. By working with `chi = ln(rho)`, it ensures `rho` remains positive. Electron number conservation is handled by transforming the gradient and search directions appropriately and by iterative rescaling in `ConstrainLog`. The use of an inner CG for the Newton step with a finite-difference Hessian-vector product makes it matrix-free. The preconditioner aims to improve the convergence of this inner CG loop.
